## About

This project was built using Vite + React as a minimal base for creating these UI elements.

There are two components: Card and Navbar. These components have their own stylesheets and React files in the `src/components`
directory. The main home page has its styles inside of `src/App.css`.

## How to run locally

1. Install packages

```sh
$ pnpm install
# ...
```

2. Run the server

```
